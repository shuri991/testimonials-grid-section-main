       <p class="Review-paragraphs1">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br>were current, if not more so, 
        in the company I joined. I<br>honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p> 
  
       <p class="Review-paragraphs2">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a<br> 
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
        for<br>the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
        The next 12<br>weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
        the course, I’ve<br>successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        <p class="Review-paragraphs1">The team was very<br>supportive and kept me<br>motivated</p> 
      
        <p class="Review-paragraphs2">“ I started as a total newbie with<br>virtually no coding skills. I now work<br>as a mobile engineer 
          for a big<br>company. This was one of the best<br>investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

        <p class="Review-paragraphs3">Such a life-changing<br>experience. Highly<br>recommended!</p> 
       
        <p class="Review-paragraphs2">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve<br>never written a line of code. I needed<br>some structure from 
         professionals<br>who can help me learn programming<br>step by step. I was encouraged to<br>enroll by a former 
         student of theirs<br>who can only say wonderful things<br>about the program. The entire<br>curriculum and staff 
         did not<br>disappoint. They were very hands-on<br>and I never had to wait long for<br>assistance. The agile team 
         project, in<br>particular, was outstanding. It took<br>my learning to the next level in a way<br>that no tutorial 
         could ever have. In<br>fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br>interviews as an example of my<br>developent 
         experience. It certainly<br>helped me land a job as a full-stack<br>developer after receiving multiple<br>offers. 
         100% recommend! ”</p>

       <p class="Review-paragraphs1">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp<br>themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
        learning from<br>their experiences was easy.</p> 
      
       <p class="Review-paragraphs2">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
        an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
